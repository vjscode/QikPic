# QikPic

This app helps you to take pictures of things that you usually capture to remember certain things for a while. Parking lot pictures to remember where you parked, whiteboards, receipts, dresses, things that go to my wish list and so on. Pictures that I wont upload on instagram, flickr, google drive.

Here is the feature list

- Take pictures and save them in the cloud
- QikPic removes the photo from phone, so they dont waste premium storage
- Tag your pictures to identify why you uploaded them
- Search uploaded photos by tag
